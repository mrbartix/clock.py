# clock.py

A spaghetti coded clock, which includes a clock, a stopwatch and an alarm. \
First started in lua, but then moved to python.

## Installation

### Windows, most linux distros, macOS:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Arch linux:
Download `python-yaml` from the extra repository using `pacman`.\
Download `python-readchar` and `python-playsound3` from the AUR.

## Configuration

The config file is `config.yaml`, **keep it in the same directory as the script**.\
Everything is explained in the file, so I am not going to repeat myself.
